# PomodoroTimerBuiltByRRESCRIBE

A simple pomodoro timer built in html that works offline and only uses native html resources. I decided to switch it up and give it more themes rather than just a dark theme. Again, all you need to do is just download the html file to your computer and run it, it should open on your browser of choice.
